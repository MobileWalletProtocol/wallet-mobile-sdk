[Coinbase Wallet Mobile SDK](https://github.com/coinbase/wallet-mobile-sdk) is an open source SDK which allows you to connect your native mobile applications to millions of Coinbase Wallet users.

## Platforms

The SDK is available for the following platforms:

- [iOS](https://cocoapods.org/pods/CoinbaseWalletSDK)
- [Android](https://mavenlibs.com/maven/dependency/com.coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk)

We also provide wrapper libraries and modules for [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coinbase/wallet-mobile-sdk) and [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/coinbase_wallet_sdk) applications.

## Features

- **Easy**: Simplified and improved wallet integration for native mobile applications via deep-linking, without requiring a web application.
- **Decentralized and reliable**: Doesn't depend on external services and relay servers for delivering messages and app-to-wallet communication. 
- **Secure**: Utilizes end-to-end encryption with secure key exchange and decentralized identity verification using the well-known URI standard for universal links.
- **Efficient**: Reduces the number of hops between client applications and wallet via support for batch requests.
- **Open-source**: All of the code for Coinbase Wallet Mobile SDK is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/coinbase/wallet-mobile-sdk).
